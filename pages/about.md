My **Linux** journey began in **2004**, when a friend of mine showed me a newly installed command line version of **Ubuntu 4**.

I was amazed by the size of the installation, the speed and the apparent "**simplicity**". But mostly I was amazed by the **CLI (command line)** applications, like `irssi` and `teamspeak server`. At that time, the Linux world didn't have that many applications and many of them required compilation under specific Linux distributions and dependencies. I remember searching through **Ubuntu repositories** and installing all the applications that seemed interesting.

Because I wanted a desktop environment and **Linux desktops** had fewer (apparent) apps than **Windows** and I was lacking a Linux basic knowledge, it took years before I really got into the Linux world.

Over the years I tried many Linux distribution flavours, like **Knoppix**, **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Arch**, **Manjaro** and **Raspbian OS**. There isn't one that I like most. At this moment, I just know more about Debian based Linux distributions, but I'm always learning.

Now, I created this blog to server me as **notepad**, were otherwise all the notes about specific applications/installations/configurations are scattered throughout **many machines** and **various external drives**. It drives me nuts every time to search for that specific task that I know I managed best a few months ago.

Also, this blog might be **beneficial to others**, as I previously had a **blogpost.com** blog that got **deleted by Google automated system** for an unknown reason, that had quite a few visitors over time.

Now, for the technologies and libraries that I have used on creating this blog, you can check the [source code](https://github.com/linuxside/website), but I'm going to summarize them here, as well: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
